"""Fetch ad images from public URLs without letting the fetch reach private hosts.

The fetched bytes are uploaded into the user's Google Ads account, where
they become visible. A fetch that could be steered at an internal address
(cloud metadata, a database admin page, a loopback service) would therefore
be a way to exfiltrate whatever lives there. So, unlike the up/down
reachability check for landing pages, this fetcher closes the DNS-rebinding
gap:

* the hostname is resolved exactly once per request, and every resolved
  address must be public;
* the TCP connection goes to that resolved address (pinning) — the socket
  never resolves the name again — while the request still carries the
  original ``Host`` header and, for https, TLS uses the original hostname
  for SNI and certificate verification;
* redirects are followed by hand (at most ``MAX_REDIRECTS``), each hop
  re-validated and re-pinned;
* the body is streamed under a hard size cap and a wall-clock deadline;
* the content is trusted only after sniffing the bytes, never by
  ``Content-Type``.

No cookies, credentials or auth headers are ever sent.
